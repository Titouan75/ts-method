# About My Timestamping Process

I care deeply about the integrity of my creative work — whether poetry, photography, or documentary.
To protect and date each piece I share, I use OpenTimestamps, a free and open protocol that records a unique cryptographic fingerprint of my files in a public, tamper-proof ledger (Bitcoin).

This use of blockchain is purely archival — with no tokens, no NFTs, and no financial transaction.
The timestamp remains invisible in the file, but can independently verify that I held the original version at a specific date.

## Why I use timestamping

- To prove **authorship and creative priority**  
- To protect the originality of my images and texts  
- To avoid speculative or ownership systems like NFTs

## How it works (in simple terms)

1. I create my work (photo, poem, etc.)  
2. I generate a secure timestamp using [OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org)  
3. I store the **original file + its proof** securely  
4. If needed, I can **prove the date of creation** to anyone, without relying on third parties

## Want to verify a timestamp?

Feel free to contact me if you wish to verify the timestamp of any of my works.  
I will provide the necessary files for independent verification.

*This is part of my broader commitment to open tools, digital responsibility, and authorship integrity.*
